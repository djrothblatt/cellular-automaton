INTERESTING RULES (with initial zero matrix)

IR 1: Without spillover, loops patterns (with spillover, just flashes)
If n % 2 = 0, pattern eventually zeroes out
Otherwise, pattern loops without zeroing out
[
	[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
	[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0] 
]

IR 2: I can't explain the non-spill pattern, but it's cool.

[
	[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
	[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1] 
]

IR 3: Starts out with a staircase
[
	[1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
	[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1] 
]
